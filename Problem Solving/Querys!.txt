This file will contain a list of different query and how to solve them.

Min/Max in a range (updates and no updates)
- Solvable by BIT or Segment tree in log(n)

Range sum query (updates and no updates)
- Solvable by BIT or Segment tree in log(n)

Smallest number not in the range
- Moes Algorithm (no updates). To do this in log(n) * (Moes alg complexity), keep track of the unique elements in your current
  range in a bit, using ones and zeros to represent there and not there and a frequency array to see if you should add/remove to the bit.
  To do the actual query do the BIT trick where you walk the bit to find the first occurence of a zero.  
- (No current solution for updates)
  
Unique elements in range
- Moes Algorithm (no updates).
- Persistent segment tree (updates).
