You can solve certain tree query problems using Mos Algorithm.
First you do a pre order post order conversion on the tree to turn it into an array
of indices. Then you can simply do moes algorithm and sort the querys, if an index
is in your range twice then you know that you went down and up that subtree and thus 
the element should be removed.
